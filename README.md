Programming_language_principle
==============================

Implement a compiler for a small-scale programming language

To use this compiler, just download the HowToUse folder, move your working directory to this, and run
  java -XX:-UseSplitVerifier -cp .:plp.jar:asm-4.2.jar cop5555fa13.Compiler fading.plp  
in you shell (mine is mac, you may need some small changes...)

we have some demo .plp files, you can try them too
